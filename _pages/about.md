Hola 

I am a data scientist working for more than five years now. I like solving impactful problems because of the challenges they offer and learning opportunities one can discover along the way. 

I've been mainly working on projects involving text data using deep learning. Some of the use cases I've worked on are:

* **Search Models**: Building models to enhance relevancy in search results
* **Recommendation Models**: Improving user discovery of products on a platform
* **Text Duplication**: Building a data product which can efficienty identify duplicate text. 

I am the author & maintainer of [superml](https://saraswatmks.github.io/superml/) R package. It helps people build ML models in R just like using scikit-learn. A lot of my weekend time goes in improving it.
