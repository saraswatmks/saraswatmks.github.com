## Hallo!

I am a machine learning engineer with more than 10 years of experience turning complex data challenges into production-ready ML systems. I love building scalable systems powered by AI/ML. I follow a three-step framework: **Feasibility, Prototype, and Production**.

I specialize in building AI/ML systems at scale that deliver real business impact. I speak english, spanish and basic german.


## Key Projects & Impact

I've worked on projects involving mainly text and tabular data using deep learning and general ML algorithms:

## Open Source Contributions

### [superml](https://saraswatmks.github.io/superml/) - R Package

I am the author and maintainer of **superml**, an R package that brings scikit-learn-like functionality to R users. The package helps data scientists build ML models in R with an intuitive API similar to Python's scikit-learn.

**Key Features:**
- Scikit-learn inspired API design
- Support for common ML algorithms
- Easy-to-use interface for R users
- Active maintenance and community support


## Talks & Presentations

I enjoy sharing my knowledge through talks and presentations. Here are some of my featured talks:

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow ML practitioners, discussing interesting problems, exploring collaboration opportunities or just meeting over a cup of coffee!
