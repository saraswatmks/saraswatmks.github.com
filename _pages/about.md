Hola

![somewhere-in-peru](/assets/images/mcpichu.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

I am a data scientist working for more than seven years now. I like solving impactful problems because of the challenges they offer and learning opportunities one can discover along the way. I usually follow a three step framework while solving a problem: Feasability, Prototype and Production.

I've been working on projects involving mainly text and tabular data using deep learning or general ML algorithms. Some of the use cases I've worked on are:

- **Ranking**: Rank restaurants based on their click probability
- **Search Models**: Building models to enhance relevancy in search results
- **Recommendation Models**: Improving user discovery of products on a platform
- **Text Duplication**: Building a data product using open source technologies which can efficiently identify duplicate text.

Besides, I like to mentor people and ensure that everyone in the team learns something new besides their day to day job. Earlier, I had been actively involved in my sharing my data science knowledge through blogging, here you can find [my articles](https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/author/manish/).

Also, I am the author & maintainer of [superml](https://saraswatmks.github.io/superml/) R package. It helps people build ML models in R just like using scikit-learn.
